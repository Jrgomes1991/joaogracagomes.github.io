# Hi, I'm João Graça Gomes 👋

![João Graça Gomes](assets/Joao_short.JPG){: style="width:120px; border-radius:50%; display:block; margin:auto;" }

I'm a Postgraduate Researcher at Imperial College London's Dyson School of Design Engineering, where I focus on **techno-economic models for decarbonising power systems**. In other words, I explore ways to make energy systems cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable.  

I’m fascinated by the intersection of **energy, economy, and policy**, and I love turning complex research into insights that actually make a difference in the real world.  

On this site, you’ll find:  
- **Resume** – My academic and professional journey  
- **Articles** – Opinions, reflections, and ideas I’m passionate about  
- **Studies** – Summaries of my research and projects  
- **Teaching** – Materials, courses, and mentoring experiences  
- **Consultancy** – How I can help with energy and tech projects  
- **Hobbies** – What I do when I’m not immersed in energy systems  

Feel free to explore, get inspired, or just say hi! You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jggomes/).
